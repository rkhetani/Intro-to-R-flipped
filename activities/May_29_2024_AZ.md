We will start by creating a new Project called `Exercises`, with a folder named `data`.

## Reading in and inspecting data

1. Download the [animals.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-R-flipped/master/data/animals.csv), by right-clicking on the link and "Save Link As..." into a folder on your computer. Upload the file into the data directory in your new project on SCP.
2. Read the `.csv` file into your environment and assign it to a variable called `animals`. **Be sure to check that your row names are the different animals.**
3. Check to make sure that `animals` is a dataframe.
4. How many rows are in the `animals` dataframe? How many columns?


## Data wrangling

1. Extract the `speed` value of 40 km/h from the `animals` dataframe.
2. Return the rows with animals that are the `color` Tan.
3. Return the rows with animals that have `speed` greater than 50 km/h and output only the `color` column. Keep the output as a data frame.  
4. Change the color of "Grey" to "Gray". 
5. Create a list called `animals_list` in which the first element contains the speed column of the `animals` dataframe and the second element contains the color column of the `animals` dataframe. 
6. Give each element of your list the appropriate name (i.e speed and color).

## Plotting

1. Change the `animals` data frame to a tibble called `animals_tb`. Save the row names to a column called `animal_names` before turning it into a tibble.

	</p>

2. Use ggplot2 to plot the animal names (x-axis) versus the speed of the animal (y-axis) in `animals_tb` using a scatterplot. Customize the plot to display as shown below.

	</p>

3. We decide that our plot would look better with the animal names ordered from slowest to fastest. Let's try to plot that!
